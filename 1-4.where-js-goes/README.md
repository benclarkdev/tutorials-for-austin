# Where JS Goes

Javascript is a great language to learn first because you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. Most of the javascript you are writing now doesn't have a context, so this article will give you some idea of where JS can work.

As far as I know, JS is always used to define what a webpage does. This is called `client-side` javascript. Here's what that means:

The internet is more or less divided between `servers` and `clients`. Your web browser is a `client`. When you go to a website, it makes a request to a `server` which takes that request and issues a response.

Where it gets confusing: You can write servers in a lot of languages. I have written them in C# (C-sharp), javascript, and typescript. We'll get to those later.

The point, though, is that javascript can be used on both the `server` and the `client`. When it comes down to it, javascript is just a language through which you can issue instructions for a computer to interpret. 

Javascript instructs what a web browser should do with a web page.

It also instructs what a web server should do with incoming requests.
