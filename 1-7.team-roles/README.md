# Who works on a software team?

Not every team has all of these people. Some are only developers, actually.

Developers write the code. Sometimes this is split between front-end and back-end.

Quality Assurance usually tests the application the developers write. They issue tasks that highlight issues. Those are called bugs. Computers used to be so big that bugs were caused by actual bugs, believe it or not.

Designers draw up what everything should look like and what the user experience should be.

Product Managers typically coordinate meetings and manage relationships with your clients.

Product Owners are specific to the agile process. They just provide feedback on how the product looks, so far. Sometimes, they are the client.
