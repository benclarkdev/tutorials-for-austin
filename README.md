# What is this?
This is a collection of articles on being a developer.

# How does it work?
I'll post new lessons as I think of them. Each lesson will be numbered and labeled. Here's the key to their numbering.

First is the topic complexity `1` is easy, `5` is hard.
Next is an id number for that level.
Finally, the label for the lesson.

# Where should I start?
Probably start with the 1's and move up.

Each lesson will contain a `README.md` file. Start there.
