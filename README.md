# What is this?
This is a collection of javascript tutorials.

# How does it work?
I'll post new lessons as I think of them. Each lesson will be numbered and labeled. Here's the key to their numbering.

First is the topic complexity `1` is easy, `5` is hard.
Next is an id number for that level.
Finally, the label for the lesson.

# Where should I start?
Some folders will only contain one file. Others will contain multiple files. I'll use another `README.md` like this. So, start with `1-1.structuring-websites`.
